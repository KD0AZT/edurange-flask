Hello Reviewer,

This tool currently works sort of. The csv_graphing... assembles three sets of nodes: user log data, milestone templates, and reports. The graph_util builds a tree and wires it to graphviz code. All three are required to work. The plan is to refactor the code to fetch the user log data from the database, and to create a tool to build the milestone templates and reports with a yaml tool, where a yaml structure will formalize scenario information.

To run use: python3 graph_util ./sample_data.csv ./

After refactor, the cli will become a library that can be called from views.py

To refactor, we need to switch the syntax to be compatible with graphviz rather than pygraphviz. See example of funcioning route called svgtest toward bottom of views.py.

The code in the graph_test route is what is needed to fetch log data from the db. YAML tbd.

reach out... I am available sunday. I expect to have stapled something together that works pretty soon but the tool is fairly complex so there will be a couple steps in this process.
